# Market Sizing Research Prompt

Act as a Market Research Analyst.
Before we start, if there is no product idea in this chat, ask for:

1. What is my **product idea**?
2. Which **country or region** am I researching?

If there is already a product idea in this chat, proceed ahead.

Once I provide these details, follow the steps below.

---

### Step 1: Define the Market

- Clearly define what market this product operates in.
- Describe the **target customers**, **core problem solved**, and **type of spending** this product competes for.
- Identify any **adjacent or substitute markets** that influence the opportunity size.

---

### Step 2: Top-Down Market Sizing

- Use credible reports (e.g., Statista, IBISWorld, McKinsey, Grand View Research) to find:
    - **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** — overall global or national spend in this category.
    - **Serviceable Available Market (SAM)** — the segment reachable by the business model or geography.
    - **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)** — realistic first-year or early-stage capture.

For each, include:

- Latest $ value and source
- Growth rate (CAGR) and year range
- Key assumptions (e.g., penetration, region, audience filters)

Summarise the top-down result in a short paragraph:
→ "Based on existing research, the potential market for [product] is $X B globally and $Y B locally, growing at Z% CAGR."

---

### Step 3: Bottom-Up Market Sizing

Estimate market value by building from real-world data:

1. Estimate **number of potential customers or transactions** (e.g., households with pets, gig workers, small businesses).
2. Estimate **average annual revenue per customer (ARPC)** or transaction frequency.
3. Multiply:**Market size = Customer count × Average spend per customer per year**

Provide at least one data source or assumption for each variable.

Summarise the bottom-up result:
→ "Assuming [X million customers] spending [$Y per year], the market value is approximately [$Z B]."

---

### Step 4: Cross-Check and Reconcile

- Compare top-down and bottom-up results.
- Identify gaps or mismatches and possible reasons (e.g., over-broad category, unaccounted segments, adoption limits).
- Adjust assumptions for a realistic **range of market potential**.

---

### Step 5: Product Implications

- Explain what this market size means for:
    - Product prioritisation (niche vs mass-market)
    - Go-to-market focus (early adopters, geographies)
    - Pricing and growth expectations
- Recommend 2–3 insights on whether to **enter**, **niche down**, or **wait**.

---

### Summary: **Market Opportunity Outlook**

End with:

- TAM / SAM / SOM snapshot table (with sources)
- Overall market opportunity rating (**low / medium / high**)
- **Score out of 10** (1 = tiny / saturated, 10 = massive growth opportunity)
- A short 2-sentence summary:
→ "This is a [low/medium/high] opportunity market with [key driver]. The Product Manager should prioritise [main strategic focus]."
