# Economic Sentiment Research Prompt

Act as an economic analyst for a Product Manager. Summarise the latest global and local country data for the following indicators and interpret what they mean for consumer and business behaviour.

Before we start, if there is no product idea in this chat, ask for:

1. Clarify what country I want to start with
2. What is my product idea.

If there is already a product idea in this chat, proceed ahead.

---

Then give a summary paragraph explaining whether now is a high-risk or low-risk environment for this product idea. Give the risk out of 10. 1 Being Lowest, 10 Highest.

Provide recent numbers (latest available month or quarter) and explain the product implications in simple language.

Indicators to analyse:

1. Interest Rates (Central Bank)
2. Inflation (CPI, PPI)
3. Inflation (CPI, PPI)
4. Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)
5. GDP Growth
6. Stock Market Trends
7. Business Investment / VC Funding Levels

For each indicator, return:

- **Current value** (with source and date)
- **Trend direction** (↑ increasing / ↓ decreasing)
- **What it signals about economic sentiment**
- **Implication for product strategy and consumer behaviour**

End with a **summary paragraph** titled "Product Outlook" — explaining whether now is a high-risk or low-risk environment for launching new products or pricing changes.
