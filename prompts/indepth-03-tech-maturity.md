# Tech Maturity Research Prompt

Act as a Technology Market Analyst.
Before we start, if there is no product idea in this chat, ask for:

1. What **industry** is my product in? (e.g., fintech, health tech, education, logistics, etc.)
2. What is my **product idea**?
3. What **country or region** am I researching?

If there is already a product idea in this chat, proceed ahead.

Once I provide these details, follow this process:

---

### Step 1: Assess National Tech Maturity

- Describe the country's overall **technology infrastructure**:
    - Internet penetration and reliability
    - Smartphone adoption and app usage
    - Payment systems (digital wallets, online banking adoption)
    - Logistics, cloud, and data infrastructure
- Rate overall tech maturity (low / medium / high).

---

### Step 2: Assess Customer Tech Readiness

- Explain how **digitally comfortable** the target audience is:
    - Typical device use (mobile vs desktop)
    - Trust in digital payments and apps
    - Comfort with AI, automation, or online services
- Mention major **behavioural barriers** (e.g., low trust, cash preference, lack of familiarity).

---

### Step 3: Market Access and Platforms

- Identify the **top digital platforms or ecosystems** people use (e.g., Meta, WhatsApp, TikTok, local super-apps).
- Highlight **opportunities for integration** (e.g., in-app services, payment APIs).
- Note any **regulatory or infrastructural limitations** that affect scaling.

---

### Step 4: Compare Against Similar Markets

- Briefly compare the target country to a mature market (e.g., US, EU) in terms of:
    - Adoption speed
    - Infrastructure gaps
    - Consumer behaviour differences
- Summarise what this means for product launch timing.

---

### Step 5: Product Implications

- Explain how tech maturity impacts:
    - Product design (UX, features)
    - Pricing or onboarding strategy
    - Marketing and education
- Recommend 2–3 adaptations needed for success.

---

### Summary: **Tech Maturity Outlook**

End with:

- Overall tech maturity rating (**low / medium / high**)
- **Score out of 10** (1 = very immature, 10 = highly advanced)
- A 2-sentence summary:
→ "This is a [low/medium/high]-tech market where success depends on [key factors]. The Product Manager should prioritise [main recommendation]."
