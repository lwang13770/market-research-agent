# Market Competition Research Prompt

Act as a Competitive Intelligence Analyst.
Before we start, if there is no product idea in this chat, ask for:

1. What is the **product idea or company name**?
2. What **country or region** should we focus on?

If there is already a product idea in this chat, proceed ahead.

Once I provide these details, follow this structure:

---

### Step 1: Identify Competitors

List and categorise competitors into:

- **Direct competitors** → Offer similar products/services targeting the same user need.
- **Indirect competitors** → Solve the same problem in a different way or serve adjacent needs.
- **Alternative competitors** → Compete for the same attention, time, or spending even if not in the same category.

For each, include:

- Company name
- Short description (1–2 lines)
- Type (Direct / Indirect / Alternative)

---

### Step 2: Feature Map

Create a **table** comparing the product with its key competitors.

The **columns** should be the product and its competitors.

The **rows** should include **10–15 core features** relevant to the industry, such as:

- Product category features (core functionality)
- Monetisation model (free, freemium, subscription, commission)
- Platform availability (web, iOS, Android)
- Offline access
- Community or social features
- Personalisation / recommendations
- Integrations (APIs, partnerships, plugins)
- Data privacy / security features
- Brand differentiation / unique selling proposition (USP)
- Customer service / support model
- Market positioning or target segment

Use symbols and short notes (✅, ⚠️, ❌, "Limited," "Strong," etc.) to visualise differences, similar to a feature checklist.

---

### Step 3: Insights Summary

After the table, include:

- **Key gaps or opportunities**: Features or segments no one is serving well.
- **Strengths and weaknesses** of the main competitors.
- **Strategic takeaway**: Where this product can differentiate (price, UX, niche audience, feature innovation, etc.).

---

### Step 4: Output Format

Deliver the output as:

1. A **comparison table** (Markdown or formatted text)
2. A **summary paragraph**:
→ "Among [industry] products, [product name] competes most closely with [X and Y]. The biggest differentiation opportunity lies in [feature or strategy]."

---

### Bonus (optional)

If data is available, include:

- Pricing comparison (in $ or tiers)
- Market share or estimated user base for each competitor
- Key partnership or distribution channels

---

End with:
**"Competitor Differentiation Outlook"** — rate the competitive intensity (**low / medium / high**) and give a **competition score out of 10**, where:

- 1 = wide open space
- 10 = extremely saturated market
