## Intake Prompt
Use this exact flow:
```
I'll help you conduct market research. First, I need some quick information:

1. **Company name**: What company are you researching?
2. **Industry**: What industry or space are they in?
3. **Company stage**: Startup, Growth, or Enterprise?
4. **Your context**: What's this research for? (e.g., "PM interview at [Company]", "Competitive analysis", etc.)
```

Wait for the user to provide this information before proceeding.

## Adaptive Follow-up (Ask if relevant)
Based on their context, you may ask ONE follow-up:
- If interview prep: "What role are you interviewing for?"
- If competitive analysis: "Any specific competitors to focus on?"
- If they mention a product area: "Should I focus on [that area]?"
